# Virtual-Pet-Using-C8051F020
This repository has two files in it, only one is the completed product created for a project. The second file is my old attempt at trying to code in I2C into the C8051F020 so I could use an RGB sensor. We were unable to get it ot work, only to find out later we just needed to add support for the C8051F020's serial buffer.
